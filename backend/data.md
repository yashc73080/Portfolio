# Projects

## Frantry
Feb 2025 - Present
Project
For a hackathon, developed cross-platform mobile app for iOS and Android project that scans receipts using OCR, extracts text and infers shelf life based on food name, and stores this information in a MongoDB database. A pantry is then populated using the database, with color-coded values based on how much more time there is before the item expires. Recipes are then generated prioritizing the food items in the pantry that are expiring soon. Llama from OpenRouter was used for shelf life inferences and recipe generation. Google Cloud Vision from Google Cloud Platform was used for the OCR receipt scanner. The app was tested on the Android simulator Expo Go. 
This was a hackathon project and we won Wakefern's Overall Best Project award.

## Memories: Social Media App
Jan 2025
Project
Developed a full-stack MERN app project that can perform CRUD operations to make a simple social media app that lets users post about their memories. Used MongoDB to store users' posts. Express.js and Node.js were used for routing in the backend. React.js with Redux was used in the frontend to create a responsive UI that gets information from API routes. The frontend was deployed on Netlify and the backend was deployed on Heroku.

## TripWhiz
Oct 2024 - Jan 2025
Project
During a hackathon, I collaborated with my team to create the TripWhiz project, a full-stack web application for efficient trip planning. The platform generates optimized travel routes for journeys with multiple destinations. Built with Next.js and React.js, the frontend ensures a responsive user experience, while the Python and Flask backend manages route optimization. Using the Google Maps API from GCP, we incorporated real-time travel data for accuracy. To solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP), we implemented Christofides' algorithm to optimize routes. Additionally, a chatbot powered by OpenRouter API with the Llama 3.1 8b model provides personalized travel guidance. I deployed the project on Render.

## MBS Dashboard
Sep 2024 - Dec 2024
Project
Collaborated with a team to design and develop a full-stack Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) management system project using a comprehensive dataset of New Jersey's 2017 HMDA data.
Backend: Normalized the dataset into 3NF using PostgreSQL to ensure efficient database operations and integrity. Built the backend with Java, Maven, and Spring Boot, leveraging JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database connectivity.
Frontend: Developed a dynamic user interface using React.js and Vite.js, integrating RESTful APIs to connect the backend with the frontend.
Key Features:
- Filter mortgages based on various attributes directly from the database.
- Calculate securitization rates and total costs in real time.
- Package selected mortgages, remove them from the dataset, and manage the pool.
- Add new mortgages manually via an intuitive interface.
This system streamlined complex MBS operations and demonstrated proficiency in full-stack development, data normalization, and financial application design.

## AI Rate My Professors Assistant

## Binder
Mar 2024 - Mar 2024
Project
In a 24-hour hackathon, my team and I developed a website project that generates personalized book recommendations with machine learning. We used HTML/CSS, and JavaScript to make the front end, in which the user is prompted with 12 book choices, and they can select as many as they want and then select a button to generate 12 new choices. The back end was coded in Python using the frameworks of pandas and scikit-learn. A large dataset of books imported from Kaggle was cleaned and used for predictions. I developed a recommendation algorithm using TF-IDF Vectorizer and K-Nearest Neighbors, which allowed us to generate recommendations based on the genre of a chosen book. We used Node.js to serve the HTML file and a Python Flask server to integrate the front end and back end with HTTP requests. We also used GitHub to work collaboratively and efficiently.

## Stock Prediction Model
Feb 2024 - Feb 2024
Project
Developed a machine learning model project to predict the next day's value for the S&P 500 index. Analyzed and manipulated stock market time series data. Created with Python using yfinance, scikit-learn, and pandas. Trained data since 1990 with a Random Forest Classifier by using the Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume values for each day.
